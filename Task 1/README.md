This task involved setting up the RISC-V toolchain on Ubuntu 22.04 (VirtualBox VM), installing necessary developer tools, building the Spike RISC-V ISA Simulator and proxy kernel (pk), and verifying the setup by compiling and running a minimal uniqueness test program on Spike.

## Setup Summary
Installed core development tools: gcc, make, binutils, build-essential
Installed build utilities: autoconf, automake, libtool, bison, flex
Installed essential libraries: libmpc-dev, libmpfr-dev, libgmp-dev, zlib1g-dev
Installed other useful utilities: git, curl, vim, gtkwave
Prepared the environment for successful compilation and simulation of RISC-V programs
Downloaded and extracted SiFive prebuilt RISC-V GCC toolchain (version 8.3.0)
Configured PATH environment variable for toolchain accessibility
Installed Device Tree Compiler (dtc)
Cloned and built Spike RISC-V simulator
Cloned and built Proxy Kernel (pk)
Installed Icarus Verilog simulator
Verified tool versions and paths

## Uniqueness Test
A simple C program (`unique_test.c`) was written and compiled to verify the end-to-end RISC-V toolchain and simulator setup. The program prints a **unique ID derived from the compile-time username and hostname**, confirming successful build and execution on Spike.

## Source File:

[unique_test.c](https://github.com/RVB-05/vsdRiscvSoc/blob/main/unique_test.c)

## Compile command:

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O2 -Wall -march=rv64imac -mabi=lp64 -DUSERNAME=\"$(id -un)\" -DHOSTNAME=\"$(hostname -s)\" unique_test.c -o unique_test
```
## Run on Spike Simulator with Proxy Kernel

```bash
spike pk ./unique_test
```

## Program Output:

```
bbl loader
RISC-V Uniqueness Check
User: bhagavathy
Host: bhagavathy-VirtualBox
UniqueID: 0x34e88d61ce36574e
GCC_VLEN: 5

```
## Notes

- The UniqueID is generated by XORing the program counter address with a fixed base, ensuring uniqueness at runtime.
- This demonstrates successful cross-compilation and execution on a RISC-V environment.
- All tools (riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc, spike, pk) were verified to be installed and accessible in the system PATH.
